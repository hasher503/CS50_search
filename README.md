# Google Clone

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS

## Summary

This is a solo front-end mini-project. The goal of the project is to replicate Google's homepage, image search, and advanced search pages. This primarily meant practicing HTML and CSS to make a visually similar clone, although part of the work was also to decipher and understand Google querystrings to figure out what the GET parameters should be for each form.
